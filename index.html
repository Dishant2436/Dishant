After all, good advertising is good storytelling. And stories are often the centrepiece of all revolutions. Furthermore, it’s fair to say that educational ads perfectly capture this transformative ability. For instance, an Ad by Google increases the accessibility of artistic pursuits. Another ad in the same sphere makes a case against usage of insensitive language. That’s not all. Educational ads even have the potential to impact the educational world itself. An ad that popularises a font that aids memory retention brings this point home. Simply put, advertising can do a lot more than just increase revenue for MNCs.</p1><br>

         <pre style="color: dimgray;">A Future Without Change

Every year high school students are bombarded by university recruitment campaigns. So, while other universities showed students a perfect future, Monash University 
stood out by showing one plagued by problems.

 VMLY&R created A Future Without Change, giving students a glimpse into what our world could become if we merely adapt to the issues we face instead of changing them.
            
With the help of each faculty, the team created 17 products that shouldn’t exist. These were brought to life through a multi-sensory campaign that the public could touch, hold,
 smell, taste and interact.

StorySign by Huawei

90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, leading to communication issues, including the challenge of learning to read, which is so key to their future.
    
FCB Inferno created StorySign for Huawei, a free app that uses AI’s power to translate selected children’s books into sign language, delivered by Star, our friendly signing avatar.
    
Developed with an understanding of sign syntax to ensure a seamless translation and user experience, StorySign helps to open the world of books to deaf children and their 
families; users simply hold their phone up to the words on the page and avatar Star signs the story as the printed words are highlighted. This helps parents and children to learn 
to read together and at their own pace.
